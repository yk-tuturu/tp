## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.  
  For example, in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` can be replaced with `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets `[ ]` are optional.  
  For example, `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or simply `n/John Doe`.

* Items followed by `‚Ä¶` can be used multiple times (including zero times).  
  For example, `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶` can be left empty, or contain `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family`, etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.  
  For example, `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER` is equivalent to `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME`.

* Commands that don‚Äôt take parameters (`help`, `list`, `exit`, `clear`) will ignore extra text.  
  For example, `help 123` is interpreted as `help`.

* When copying commands from a PDF, make sure spaces at line breaks are preserved to avoid errors.

</box>

### Locating a child record: `find`

Finds a child record. You can search for a specific child entry using their name or their parent's name. Or you can filter to find all children with a specific tag, or a specific allergy to accomodate their needs.

<box type="info" seamless>

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the corresponding field is searched. e.g. `b/hans` will only match with parents named `Hans` and not children
* Even partial words will be matched e.g. `Han` will match `Hans`, `child` will match `only child`
* Children records matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `c/Hans r/ADHD` will return records of all children named `Hans` and of all children with `ADHD`
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided
* Each category supports multi-search e.g. `c/John Marcus Hans` will return records of all children named either `John`, `Marcus` or `Hans`

</box>

### Enrolling children into a subject : `enroll`

Enrolls children into subjects in ParentConnect. Currently, we support 3 fixed subjects of `Math`, `English`, and `Science`<br>

When children are first enrolled into a subject, their scores will always be displayed as `N/A`. The [setscore](#setting-scores--setscore) command can then be used to change their scores.

Format:
`enroll INDEXES‚Ä¶‚Äã s/SUBJECT`

<box type="info" seamless>

* Enrolls all children at the specified `INDEXES` into the listed subjects.
* You can also enroll **all children** currently listed by using the `all` keyword instead of indexes. 
* `INDEXES` must be **positive integers** 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶
* `SUBJECT` refers to the subject name(s) and can be repeated to enroll a child in multiple subjects.

</box>

</box>


### Unenrolling children from a subject : `unenroll`
<box type="warning">
All information pertaining to the student's scores will also be deleted on unenrollment!
</box>

Unenrolls children from subjects in ParentConnect. The usage is largely similar to `enroll`.

Format:
`unenroll INDEXES... s/SUBJECT`

<box type="info" seamless>

* Unenrolls all children at the specified `INDEXES` from the listed subjects.
* You can also unenroll **all children** currently listed by using the `all` keyword instead of indexes.
* `INDEXES` must be positive integers 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶

### Setting scores : `setscore`

Sets the score of children for a specific subject in ParentConnect.

**Format:**  
`setscore INDEXES... s/SUBJECT g/SCORE`

<box type="info" seamless>

* Only **one subject** and **one score** can be specified per command.
* `INDEXES` must be positive integers 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶
* `SCORE` must be between 0 - 100

</box>

<box type="tip" header="Examples:">

* `setscore 2 s/science g/100`  
  Sets the Science score of the child at index 2 to 100.

* `setscore 1 2 3 s/math g/90`  
  Sets the Math score of children at indexes 1, 2, and 3 to 90.

* `setscore all s/math g/85`

</box>

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

<box type="warning">

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

ParentConnect data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

ParentConnect data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Backup save files can be created just by making copies of this save file at regular intervals. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="important">

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ParentConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the ParentConnect to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: I made a mistake by bulk deleting some children. Can I undo? <br>
**A**: No, unfortunately ParentConnect does not have an undo feature. However, if you have a backup of your data file, 
you can restore the deleted data by replacing the current data file with your backup. 

**Q**: Does ParentConnect support enrollment for subjects other than those listed?<br>
**A**: This is a known issue, and it is one of the features coming soon in release `2.0`

**Q**: Where can I find the data file?<br>
**A**: The data file is located in the `data` folder inside your ParentConnect home folder (i.e., the folder where the 
jar file is located).

**Q**: Can I use ParentConnect on my mobile device?<br>
**A**: No, ParentConnect is a desktop application and does not support mobile devices.

**Q**: Can I use ParentConnect without the GUI?<br>
**A**: No, while ParentConnect is optimized fast typists, it still requires the GUI to operate since we want to make 
information visualisation easier.

**Q**: How do I report bugs or suggest new features?<br>
**A**: Please visit our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-4/tp/issues) and make a new issue.
We welcome all kinds of feedback!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
